The reality is that the Outlands is made up of uncountable Regions - a bit of stable land that takes, at most, a few days to cross on foot. Once you leave the bounds of a Region you enter the Wilds, a trackless, dangerous, and shifting expanse. If you know the Ways you can find a path that leads to another Region, otherwise you could be lost in the Wilds forever.</p>
      <p>Regions are grouped into Planes by their common terrain, and the Planes have been given various names. The Regions of the Dreaming Veldt are all rolling plains and grasslands. While the Jungles of Memory are all Regions covered in thick jungle. It is easier to travel between the Regions within a Plane. </p>
