# Outlands
This is a game of exploration. You start on a random map as a blue diamond. Click on the map to move from place to place. At any time you can explore where you are.

You gain points by exploring. You will find new routes, resources, people, ruins... But every time you move or explore it takes time. Exploring isn't easy - you can face setbacks. All of which takes more time.

The game will reset every week. How many points can you get? How many points in the least amount of time?
